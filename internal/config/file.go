# This is the shared configuration file. It is written by the

# can also be edited manually. After editing, restart the
# server to pick up changes.
#
# You can also read and write single values without a TOML
# parser, which is how the launcher scripts use it:
#   gobbonet config get llm_url
#   gobbonet config set llm_url http://192.168.1.100:8080
# ================================================================

# --- Upstream llama.cpp server ------------------------------------------
# Base URL of the llama-server process. This can be:
#   http://127.0.0.1:11437      - local llama.cpp server
#   http://192.168.1.100:8080   - remote machine on your LAN
#                                 (8080 is llama.cpp's own default)
#   https://your-server.com     - remote with TLS
#
# The UI and chat state are served by this program. The llama.cpp
# server handles model inference. They talk over HTTP.
#
# 11437 and not 11434 because 11434 is Ollama's port. Sharing it meant
# the launcher saw Ollama answering, assumed llama-server was already
# up, and never started its own.
llm_url = "http://127.0.0.1:11437"

# --- Optional upstream services -----------------------------------------
# If nothing answers, features degrade gracefully: web search turns off
# and RAG falls back to tag-only retrieval. Leave empty to disable.
#
# search_url is the web-search API this server forwards /search to. It is
# the ONLY upstream that is not on your machine, and it is reached only
# when you turn search on and supply your own key -- which the browser
# sends and this server passes through without storing. Point it at your
# own relay if you would rather it not talk to ollama.com directly, or
# empty it to switch the feature off.

# --- Model catalogue ----------------------------------------------------

# panel. Keeping it online means models added after your install show up
# without you reinstalling anything.
#
# This is the second and last thing GobboNet fetches from the internet,
# after web search. What it sends: a plain GET for a static ~5 KB JSON
# file. No query parameters, no cookies, no identifier, no telemetry, and
# in particular NOT your hardware -- the whole list is downloaded and
# filtered on your machine rather than asking a server what fits your GPU.
# The browser is never involved; this binary does the fetching.
#
# The answer is cached for a day, so this is at most one request per day
# and usually fewer. Set model_catalog_remote = false to switch it off
# entirely: nothing is requested, and the list comes from the cache or
# the models.ini that shipped with GobboNet. Downloading a model still
# works either way.

# port every other dev tool also wants, and on Windows the ranges
# Hyper-V, WSL2 and Docker reserve can swallow it -- which shows up as a
# bind failure that netstat cannot explain. If you change this, stay
# under 32768: above that you are in the range Windows hands out to

# --- Local-backend (hot-swap) settings ----------------------------------
# Set server_exe to the llama-server binary to run in LOCAL MODE, where
# this program starts, supervises and hot-swaps llama.cpp for you.
#
# Leave it empty for REMOTE MODE, where llm_url points at a server that
# something else manages. Both modes have full feature parity except
# hot-swap: auth, state sync, generation jobs, web search, RAG, and

# not data, so nothing large is ever written next to this file.
